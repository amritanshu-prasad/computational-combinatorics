# Introduction

Combinatorics is the study of structures on finite sets, such as graphs, permutations, and subsets.
Each structure may be regarded as a *combinatorical class*.
In this book, we understand combinatorial classes by computation.
For each class we look at formulae for counting its number of elements, different ways of generating its elements, and different ways of sampling from it.

The computation is done using python, therefore, basic familarity with python is a prerequisite.
Computation is demonstrated using Jupyter notebooks, which allow us to mix code, text, and mathematical formulae.
The chapters that are based on Jupyter notebooks can be downloaded and run on your own computer.
