# Independence

## Repeated Coin Toss

Suppose you have a fair coin, meaning that, every time you toss the coin, there is equal chance that it lands heads or tails.

In particular, if you toss this coin two times, the outcome of the second toss will not depend on the outcome of the first toss.

Each time we get a head, let us record the result by writing "H", and each time we get a tail, let us record the result by writing "T".

For two coin tosses, there are four possibilies, namely:

HH, HT, TH, TT.

What is the probability of each of these outcomes?

Let us consider the outcome HH. This means that the both tosses result in heads.
The first toss will land head about half the time.
Half of the those first tosses will lead to the second toss also landing heads.
Therefore the probability of both tosses landing heads is $\frac 12\times \frac 12 = \frac 14$.

A similar reasoning will show that each of the four outcomes of two coin-tosses has probability $1/4$.

## A Pair of Dice

When a pair of dice are rolled, the outcome of the second die does not depend on the outcome of the first die.
Let $X$ denote the outcome of the first die, and $Y$ denote the outcome of the second die.
Assuming that each die is fair, we have:

$$
P(X=i) = \frac 16, \quad i=1,2,3,4,5,6 \text{ and } P(Y=j) = \frac 16, \quad j=1,2,3,4,5,6.
$$


## Independent Events

Let $A$ and $B$ denote two "events".
For example while considering two tosses of a fair coin, $A$ could be the event that the first toss lands head, and $B$ could be the event that the second toss lands head.
Each event has a certain probability of occurence.
We will denote the  probability of even
