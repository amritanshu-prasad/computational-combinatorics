# Permutations
### Definition
A permutation on $n$ letters is a sequence $w=(w_0,w_1,\ldots,w_{n-1})$ where each of the numbers $1,2,\ldots,n$ appears exactly once.
### Example
There are six permutations of on three letters, namely:
$$ 
(1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), (3,2,1).
$$
When $n$ is small (less than 10), the parentheses and comma can be omitted.
With the abbreviated notation, the six permutations of three letters are:
$$
123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321.
$$
