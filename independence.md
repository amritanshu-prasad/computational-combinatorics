## Repeated Coin Toss

Suppose you have a fair coin.
This means that, every time you toss the coin, there is equal chance that it lands heads or tails.

In particular, if you toss this coin two times, the outcome of the second toss will not depend on the outdome of the first toss.
This is because the coin has no memory of the first toss.
If, by some fluke of chance the first ten tosses are heads, there is equal chance that it lands head or tail on the eleventh toss.

Each time we get a head, let us record the result by writing "H", and each time we get a tail, let us record the result by writing "T".

For two coin tosses, there are four possibilies, namely:

HH, HT, TH, TT.

What is the probability of each of these outcomes?

Let us consider the outcome HH. This means that the both tosses result in heads.
What is the probability?
The probability of getting H in the first toss is $1/2$.
Independent of that, the probability of getting H in the second toss is also $1/2$.
