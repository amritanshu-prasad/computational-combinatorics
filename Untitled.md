# Generating Permutations using Fischer-Yates shuffles

Let $w=w_1\dotsb w_n$ be a permutation of $n$ symbols.
Then the letter $n$ has $n$ possible positions, namely $1$ through $n$.
For example, in the permutations $1234$, $1243$, $1423$ and $4123$, the letter $n=4$ has positions $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$ respectively.
