    "# Permutations\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "A permutation on $n$ letters is a sequence $w=(w_0,w_1,\\ldots,w_{n-1})$ where each of the numbers $1,2,\\ldots,n$ appears exactly once.\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "There are six permutations of on three letters, namely:\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "(1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), (3,2,1).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "When $n$ is small (less than 10), the parentheses and comma can be omitted.\n",
    "With the abbreviated notation, the six permutations of three letters are:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321.\n",
